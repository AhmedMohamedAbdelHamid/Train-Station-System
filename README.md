# Train Stations System (TSS)

## Overview

The Train Stations System (TSS) is a comprehensive database solution designed to revolutionize the operational landscape of train stations across diverse regions. This sophisticated system serves as the backbone for orchestrating seamless interactions among stations, platforms, employees, schedules, tickets, trains, reviews, passengers, payments, and bookings.

This project was provided by the **Arab Academy for Science, Technology and Maritime Transport (AAST)**.

## Features

- **Strategic Management of Station Networks**: Optimizes the management of multiple interconnected stations.
- **Platform Utilization and Coordination**: Efficiently tracks and coordinates platform usage across stations.
- **Comprehensive Employee Deployment**: Manages workforce data and deployment across the network.
- **Robust Scheduling Mechanism**: Orchestrates seamless train arrivals and departures.
- **Efficient Ticketing Operations**: Streamlines ticket management and sales.
- **Train Management**: Provides insights into train details for effective resource distribution.
- **Passenger-Centric Approach**: Includes a review system for continuous service improvement.
- **Transparent Financial Operations**: Tracks financial transactions for accountability.

## Database Schema

The TSS database includes the following key entities:

1. Station
2. Platform
3. Employee & Emp_phone
4. Schedule
5. Ticket
6. Train
7. Review
8. Passenger & Pass_Contact
9. Booking
10. Payment

## Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)

An Entity Relationship Diagram is included in the project files, visually representing the database schema and relationships between entities. You can view and edit the ERD using [diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/).

## Project Details

- This project was developed as part of an open database assignment, allowing the choice of any database system. The Train Station Database was selected for this implementation.
- The data used in this project was provided by Lead Developer and Database Designer.
- The project was assigned and overseen by the Arab Academy for Science, Technology and Maritime Transport (AAST).

## Responsibilities

- Wrote all SQL code for database creation and operations
- Designed and created the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD), including all relationships between entities
- Provided the data used in the project
- Implemented the core database functionality

## Setup and Installation

1. Locate the "Train Station SQL.zip" file in the project repository.
2. Unzip the file to extract its contents.
3. Open your preferred SQL database management system (e.g., MySQL Workbench, PostgreSQL pgAdmin, etc.).
4. Import the extracted SQL file into your database management system.
5. Execute the SQL scripts to create the database schema and populate it with initial data.

For detailed instructions on how to import and execute SQL files in your specific database management system, please refer to its documentation.
